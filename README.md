# Balancing Challenge and Enjoyment:  
## An Experimental Study of Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment in Tower Defense Games

---

## 📌 Description

This thesis project investigates the impact of **Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment (DDA)** on **player enjoyment** within the context of **tower defense games**. Traditional tower defense games often rely on static difficulty settings, which may fail to accommodate differences in player skill, experience, and learning progression. As a result, players may experience boredom when challenges are too easy or frustration when they are too difficult.

To address this issue, this study modifies an existing open-source tower defense game by integrating a **dynamic difficulty system** that adapts gameplay parameters in real time based on player performance. The modified version is then compared against a static-difficulty version through controlled player testing.

Player enjoyment is evaluated using validated player experience instruments, specifically the **Player Experience of Need Satisfaction (PENS)** and the **Game Experience Questionnaire (GEQ)**. Quantitative data from these questionnaires are analyzed to determine whether dynamic difficulty produces measurable improvements in enjoyment, perceived competence, engagement, and overall player experience.
